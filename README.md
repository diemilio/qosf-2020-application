# QOSF 2020 Application Tasks

This repository contains the solution Task #3 of the 2020 [QOSF mentorship program](https://qosf.org/qc_mentorship/) application.

This task was solved using Qiskit, for which you can find installation instructions [here](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html).

Inside the task03 folder there are three files:
1. `translate.py` contains the code of the compiler program.
2. `task03_examples.ipynb` is an IPython with a few simple examples demostrating how to use the compiler. For better rendering please use this nbviewer link.
3. `task03.ipynb` is an IPython notebook with details and examples of how the code was developed.
