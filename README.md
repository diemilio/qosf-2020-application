# QOSF 2020 Application Task

This repository contains the solution to **Task #3** of the 2020 [QOSF mentorship program](https://qosf.org/qc_mentorship/) application.

This task was solved using Qiskit, for which the installation instructions can be found [here](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html).

There are three files in this repository:
1. `task03_details.ipynb` is an IPython notebook with details and examples of how the code was developed. For better rendering you can access the file through nbviewer [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/diemilio/qosf-2020-application/blob/master/task03_details.ipynb).
2. `translate.py` contains the code of the compiler program (deliverable for this task).
3. `task03_examples.ipynb` is an IPython with a few simple examples demostrating how to use the compiler function `translate` as a stand-alone function.

Thank you,

Diego Emilio Serrano
